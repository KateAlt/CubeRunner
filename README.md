## Project Description
CubeRunner is a game designed to showcase my skills in hypercasual game development. Despite being in the development stage, it already has a unique concept and gameplay.

## Gameplay
In the game, you control a cube and collect various objects, avoid obstacles, and aim to set high scores. The gameplay is simple yet very engaging.
